# student-lifestyle-analytics
Data analysis project applying CRISP-DM on student lifestyle dataset to uncover how study, sleep, and activities impact GPA. Includes Power BI dashboard and auto-generated PDF report.

# Student Lifestyle Analytics

## Overview
This project applies the **CRISP-DM methodology** to analyze the **Student Lifestyle Dataset** from Kaggle.  
The dataset contains 2,000 records of students' daily habits (study, sleep, extracurriculars, socializing, physical activity) and their impact on **GPA**.  
The goal is to uncover **patterns in productivity and academic performance** while showcasing practical **data analyst skills**.

---

## Objectives
- Identify which lifestyle factors most strongly correlate with GPA.
- Detect potential **diminishing returns** (e.g., too much study, too little sleep).
- Compare **stress levels** vs GPA and find patterns among **top-performing students**.
- Build an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for insights.
- Automate a **Python-generated PDF report** with graphs and explanations.
